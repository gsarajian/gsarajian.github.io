    <p>Welcome to my website. I am currently partaking in the Data Science Bootcamp as part of the <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/">Erdos Institute</a> and was recently an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/academics/academic-departments/mathematical-sciences">Department of Mathematical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/">West Point</a>. I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitang_Zhang">Yitang Zhang</a>. I like thinking about numbers and the stories they hide. My theoretical math research interests are in analytic number theory, and my applied math interests are in nlp, computer vision, data science, sports analytics, and cryptography. I plan to update this website with more of my projects, both applied and theoretical, so stay tuned!</p>
          
          
      <p>Feel free to click around to learn more about my work on this website or on my <a href="https://github.com/gsarajian">github</a>. You can also reach me at my personal email, which is the first letter of my first name concatenated with my whole last name, at gmail.com. The total number of characters in my email address, including punctuation, is 19.
