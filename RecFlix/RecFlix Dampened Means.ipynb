    "#### How do we compare a movie with a single 5-star rating to one with many 4 and 5 ratings? \n",
    "Say we want to take user ratings of movies and rank them. A simple approach would be to just look at the average rating of each movie, but that doesn't feel right.. different movies have different amounts of ratings, and we don't want small samples to skew our estimate of the ''true'' rating that would arise if the whole population rated that movie. Smoothed (a.k.a. dampened) average ratings is one approach to handle this and is an example of a non-personalzed recommendation system. Let's start by looking at the highest rated movies from the [MovieLens dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jneupane12/movielens)."

The visualization is only for a sample of 50 movies so it doesn't get too cluttered. You can see that the movies with fewer ratings are pulled more towards the overall mean, and those with more ratings have budged less. There's probably a good physics interpretation of what's going on here..  perhaps computing the center of mass of a plank with a weight on it where the plank's mass depends on $\\lambda$ and the weight on top of it has a mass that depends on the number of ratings and is placed according to the movie's average rating. I don't know enough physics to truly formalize this connection.."
